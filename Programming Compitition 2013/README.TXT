                              Competition

DATE                        : 4/28/2013

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT   : The main method is located in 
                              TheFinal.java class.

AUTHOR                      : Joshua M Boone

USER INSTRUCTIONS           : The main objective is to reach the end of 
                              the course before the TIME runs out.

                              Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows to move the
                              character across the screen. 
                              Use the SPACE bar to jump and when prompted.
                              
                              10 Extra Credit(EC) tokens can be found 
                              throughout the course.
                              Each (EC) is worth 5 additional points to 
                              your main score.
                              
                              Watch out for obstacles throughout the 
                              course.
                              If your character is struck by a frisbee,
                              he will be stunned 
                              and loose upward momentum.
                              When in close proximity to musicians, your 
                              character will 
                              cover his ears, slow down, and loose the 
                              ability to jump.
                              
                              TIP: Your character can walk and jump off 
                                   the tops of frisbees.
                                   Use them to get tokens that are out of
                                   reach.
